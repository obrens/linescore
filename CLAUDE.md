# Objective

We are building an MVP for a code quality checker. It scores a unit of code. The initial idea is contained in the initial_conversation.txt file. The POC implementation is contained in the POC.py file. The POC was created by an AI during the initial conversation. 

# You should

* Review the initial conversation and the POC implementation to understand the current state of the project.
* Do not assume that the final conclusions in the initial_conversation.txt file are correct. They were generated by an AI and may contain errors or misunderstandings.
* Create a file where you will document your findings, thoughts, and next steps. This file should be clear and concise, and should include any questions or concerns you have about the project.
* Create a plan for upgrading the POC to a full MVP. 
* Do not touch the POC.py file, it should stay there as a working reference, although not necessarily as canonical truth.

# After you're done with what you are doing now

Notes for me so I don't forget what to tell you next:
* The scoring needs to change. This favors modules with fewer functions.
* The output needs to have a summary at the end.
* By default, all three checks should be performed on the specified scope if applicable.
* We will need to add statistics and analyze various open source repos, so that we can give people reference scores.
* The program breaks the terminal, writing is not visible in the terminal after the program is run.
